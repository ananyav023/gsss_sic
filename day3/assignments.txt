1. ---------->Learn output formatting in taxation problem.
Output Formatting in Taxation Problem:
When dealing with taxation problems, it's important to format the output clearly. This can include using currency symbols, decimal places 
for cents, and clear labeling of each component of the calculation
(e.g., income, tax rate, total tax owed).

2. Y in python We do not have increment or decrement operators.
Python does not have increment (++) or decrement (--) operators like
 some other languages (e.g., C, C++). Instead, you can achieve similar
 functionality using the += and -= operators. For example:
     x = 5
     x += 1  # This is equivalent to x = x + 1
     


3. ----->Learn about __main__?<--------
The __main__ block in Python is used to determine if a Python script
 is being run as the main program or if it is being imported as a 
 module in another script. Code within the if __name__ == "__main__": 
 block will only execute if the script is run directly.
This is useful for testing or running code that should not execute 
when the module is imported.


4. What is pip3 and what is pythonic?
pip3 is the package installer for Python 3. It allows 
you to install and manage additional libraries and 
dependencies that are not part of the standard Python library.
"Pythonic" refers to idiomatic Python code that follows 
the conventions and best practices of the Python community. 
This includes using clear and readable code, leveraging Python's 
built-in functions and libraries, and adhering to the Zen of Python (PEP 20).

5. --->Can we modify a list which is a tuple?
A tuple in Python is immutable, meaning that once it is created, it cannot be modified. 
You cannot change, add, or remove elements from a tuple.
 If you need a mutable sequence, you should use a list instead.
Tuple is a read-only variable in a python and sythax which 
can take any number of arguments(var_args).

A tuple is a class.

6. If we want to pass a command line argument ----->Learn.

To pass command line arguments in Python, you can use the sys module. 
The sys.argv list contains the command line arguments passed to the script. 
The first element is the script name, 
and the subsequent elements are the arguments.
For ex :
     import sys
     print(sys.argv)  # This will print the list of command line arguments
     

7. Why argv stores a file name in python, but not in java.


8. Why in python we dont have implict type casting, as in java we can add a string with int which is
excplictly converts int into string.

Python does not perform implicit type casting in the same way Java does.
 In Python, attempting to add a string and an integer will raise a TypeError.
You must explicitly convert the integer to a string using the str() function:
     num = 5
     text = "The number is: " + str(num)  # This works
     

9. Application vs software

An application is a type of software designed to help the user 
perform specific tasks, such as word processing, web browsing, or gaming.
Software is a broader term that encompasses all types of programs
 and applications that run on a computer or device, 
 including system software (like operating systems) and application software.
